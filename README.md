Project Title: Simple Token Smart Contract

Description:
This Solidity smart contract, named "Mytoken," represents a basic token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functions to create (mint) and destroy (burn) tokens. Here's a more detailed overview:

Getting Started:

Installing: No installation is required; this is a smart contract written in Solidity for Ethereum use google remix to deploy.
How/where to download your program: You can deploy this contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
Modifications: No specific modifications are needed for this contract; it's ready to be deployed as is.
Executing Program:

To use this smart contract, you would need to deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain. Once deployed, you can interact with it using Ethereum wallets or other smart contracts.
Below are the steps for deploying and interacting with it:
Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain using a development environment like Remix or Truffle.
After deployment, you can call the "mint" function to create new tokens, specifying the recipient's address and the number of tokens to create.
You can also use the "burn" function to destroy tokens held by a specific address, provided they have enough tokens to burn.
Help:

Common issues or problems are not expected for this basic token contract. However, remember that this is a simplified example and may need additional features and security measures for production use.
